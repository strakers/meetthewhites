# Meet The Whites

## Website

This was a wedding website I built for my cousin's wedding. Originally it began with an admin platform for managing guests, and an RSVP platform, but quickly evolved into a full fledged wedding website with countdowns, photos, and wedding details.

The site was built in Laravel, with designs inspired by the wedding invitations. Have a look at the public link below:
